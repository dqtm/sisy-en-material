README for Python Scripts
==========================

These Python scripts are alternative solutions to the exercises presented in the course 
with Matlab.

The scripts were originally edited in Jupyter Notebook (\*.ipynb), but are also saved as 
Python scripts (\*.py) in case you want to work with another IDE.

A practical way to get a compatible Python-IDE, Python-Libraries and Jupyter Notebook is
to download the Anaconda distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
